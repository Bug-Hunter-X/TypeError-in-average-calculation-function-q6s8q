This repository contains a Python function `calculate_average` that calculates the average of a list of numbers. The original function had a bug where it didn't handle non-numeric input correctly. The `bug.py` file shows the buggy code and `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected code. The bug was a `TypeError` caused by attempting to perform mathematical operations on non-numeric data types.
